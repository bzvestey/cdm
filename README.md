# Custom Document Manager

**WARNING:** This project is still in the early stages of me figuring out and building an understanding of how FountryTVV's API works. There will be a lot of work put into cleaning this up once I have an understanding of how everything actually works together.

Custom Document Manager is a way to handle custom documents within FoundryVTT via YAML or JSON files on the server side that will then be synced with the server data.

The initial versions of this will be focusing on items for the D&D 5E system, but should be able to handle items for any game system.
