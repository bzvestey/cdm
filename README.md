# Custom Document Manager

Custom Document Manager is a way to handle custom documents within FoundryVTT via YAML or JSON files on the server side that will then be synced with the server data.

The initial versions of this will be focusing on items for the D&D 5E system, but should be able to handle items for any game system.
